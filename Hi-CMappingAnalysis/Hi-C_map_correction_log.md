## Manual curation of Hi-C maps

**Scaffold 1:**  
Small scaffolds moved to debris  
The rest to be joined with scaffold 2
checked with map

**Scaffold 2:**  
small part of the Scaffold 274 (tig00000512) seems out of place - not corrected
scaffolds 85, 202, 200  jointly flipped
scaffold 288 doesn't have markers and may be inverted  
checked with map
**Scaffold 3:**  
tig00000407 tig00000003 flipped together
tig00000110 broke apart, fragments of debris removed  
real tandem repeat in the same tig - may be explored
tig00000258 may need editing  
checked with map

**Scaffold 4:**
check chromosomal structure  
checked with map

**Scaffold 5:**
moved to beginning scaffolds/haplotigs to debris  
and final small scaffold too/ check again fine with map
checked with map

**Scaffold 6:**  
Check end of chromosome  

**Scaffold 7:**   
no problems
checked with map

**Scaffold 8:**  
no problems
checked with map

**Scaffold 9:**
multiple loop structure
checked with map

**Scaffold 10:**  
no problems
checked with map

**Scaffold 11:**
Insertion from chromosome 13 attempt to fix
Move part of the 13 here

**Scaffold 12:**
problems
Flip first two scaffolds!!!!

**Scaffold 13:**
Insert from 11
Flip last scaffold

**Scaffold 14:**
could be inversion!


**Scaffold 15:**
no problems
checked

**Scaffold 16:**
contains large tandem repeat, doesn't seems to be artefact


**Scaffold 17:**
good!

**Scaffold 18:**  
remove little junk

**Scaffold 19:**  
approve

**Scaffold 20:**  
Second half flipped

**Scaffold 21:**
fine, checked

**Scaffold 22:**
to be split on two
need another Check

**Scaffold 23:**

**Scaffold 25:**
removed haplotig
inverted last two Mb
removed haplotig at the end
consider removing middle part

**Scaffold 26:**  
first 3 and last 2 to be flipped

**Scaffold 27:**
first scaffold moved after n2
last scaffold split moved backwards

 **Scaffold 28:**  
 last scaffold flipped

 **Scaffold 29:**
 good
 loooops

 **Scaffold 30:**
remove haplotigs

  **Scaffold 31:**  
removed middle haplotigs
